LocalSearch is an app created using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS

This app helps the user get weather, photo and event information for a specific city using data from 2 different APIs.


*Header*
- On the top right corner I implemented a digital clock 
- On the top left corner there is a button containing the list of cities the user has searched so far. 

*Content*
After the user has entered the city and clicked the search button, 
they can see a container of 3 types of results. 
1. Live weather of the searched city 
2. A list of picures regarding the searched city
3. Different kind of events happiening in the searched city. 
 --- The user has the option to choose from different kinds of events (Classical, Comedy, Theater, etc)
 The Buy Ticket button redirects the user to the SeatGeek website ticket-section.
